# Directed-Graph-of-Football-Fixtures-
The following program was written in C language to store data in graph data structure. And basic graph operation were also applied to transverse the data.

How to run the Code:                                                                                                                                                                               
1- Download and Open the Directed Graph of Football Fixtures.c file.                                                                                                                                               
2- Pass two team as a Command Line Argument. In case,
   there is two word team then put a '_'.
3- Run the Code.                                                                                                                                                                                         

Note: Make Sure txt and C file are in same directory. sample.txt is the output after executing the code, to make sure we get the same answer.
